# MPV Media Player Scripts
A Collection of scripts I've made for the MPV Media Player.

# SponsorBlock Local
Skips all segments specified in the script settings from the embedded SponsorBlock chapters created by yt-dlp.
This was made mostly for the Android version of MPV Media Player since the original SponsorBlock script doesn't work on it.

## How to use
1. Download the script and put the script in your scripts folder.
2. Edit the skip categories in the script file.
3. Play videos as you normally would. The script should skip over the segments that you've specified.
